title: "State Anxiety by Itself Does Not Change Political Attitudes: A Threat of Shock Experiment"
summary: Previous research suggests that state anxiety may sway political attitudes. However, previous experimental procedures induced anxiety using political contexts (e.g., social or economic threat). In a pre-registered laboratory experiment, we set out to examine if anxiety that is unrelated to political contexts can influence political attitudes. We induced anxiety with a threat of shock paradigm, void of any political connotation. Our results suggest that state anxiety by itself does not sway political attitudes.
