I am a computational social scientist and behavioral economist with a background in mathematics and a passion for the **quantitative modeling of political behavior**. I will obtain a Ph.D. from the [Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences (GESS)](https://gess.uni-mannheim.de/) at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/). My substantial research focuses on **coalition politics** and **electoral behavior**, especially on pre-electoral coalition politics and how it affects electoral behavior. Methodologically, I am interested in **experimental research** conducted both in the laboratory and through large-scale population-based surveys. I am also engaged in **agent-based modeling**, which I use to study party competition and opinion dynamics.
