publication_short: "*Signals for Democracy: Assessing the Impact of Pre-Electoral Coalition Signals and Cordons Sanitaires on Party Competition using Experimental, Quasi-Experimental, and Agent-Based Simulation Evidence (Dissertation), pp. 85--178*"

abstract: Ruling out forming coalition governments with parties critical of liberal democracy, i.e., establishing *cordons sanitaires* vis-à-vis these parties, is often seen as a crucial contribution to
safeguarding liberal democracy. However, little is known about whether *cordons sanitaires*
are effective in reducing the vote share of parties isolated in this way. Specifically, the effects
of *cordons sanitaires* on voting induced by changes in voters’ expectations of post-electoral
government formation remain unclear. I address this research gap by conceptualizing
*cordons sanitaires* as a specific class of pre-electoral coalition signals and drawing on theoretical
knowledge about the electoral expectation-induced consequences of coalition signals.
I integrate these theoretical insights into a formal agent-based model of dynamic party
competition and perform counterfactual simulations in an artificial democracy calibrated to
resemble the 1930s Weimar Republic. The results show that the vote share of an artificial
NSDAP increases when a *cordon sanitaire* is erected against it. By illustrating the theoretical
possibility (not inevitability) of these unintended expectation-induced consequences, the
paper provides important implications for research on the mainstream parties’ response to
radical parties.
